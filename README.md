# Group13_Capstone
Image Colorization using GAN
<br />

So Let's get started.
<br />
This repo has two notebooks.
<br />
Run the img_col notebook using google colab
<br />
All versions of libraries used in colab can be found [here](https://github.com/BitsOfPaper/Group13_Capstone/blob/main/requirements)
<br />
For interface use jupyter on local system with anaconda
<br />
All versions of libraries used on local machine can be found [here](https://github.com/BitsOfPaper/Group13_Capstone/blob/main/requirements)
<br />
Since Google Colab uses tensorflow 2.4.x and Anaconda only supports 2.1 for now
<br />saving entire model in colab and loading on local machine is not feasible.
<br />So create the architecture of the model and load the weights to use interface.
